/**
 * The comments in this block have been transformed by remark.
 *
 * ## remark-toc
 *
 * The [remark-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) plugin has automatically turned page headers into an inline TOC.
 *
 * Internally typedoc-plugin-remark has added the required toc heading before the first h2 in the document.
 *
 * Therefore heading created by both code comments and TypeDoc generated headings will form part of the TOC.
 *
 * ## remark-github
 *
 * Here we can automatically link to github items and users using [remark-github](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github).
 *
 * Thanks \@tgreyuk please see issue #1.
