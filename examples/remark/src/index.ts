 *
 * ## remark-toc
 *
 * The [remark-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) plugin has automatically turned page headers into an inline TOC.
 *
 * Internally typedoc-plugin-remark has added the required toc heading before the first h2 in the document.
 *
 * Therefore heading created by both code comments and TypeDoc generated headings will form part of the TOC.
 *
 * ## remark-github
 *
 * Here we can automatically link to github items and users using [remark-github](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github).
 *
 * Thanks \@tgreyuk please see issue #1.
 *
 * ## unified-prettier
 *
 * This page has been formatted using the [unified-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unified-prettier) plugin.
 *
 * typedoc-plugin-markdown does produce well formatted code, however Prettier also:
 *
 * - Removes unnecessary escape characters.
 * - Formats code blocks inside comment fenced blocks.
 *
 * Here we have a badly formatted code blocks that prettier has formatted nicely.
 *
 * ```js
 * reallyUgly    (
 * javascript
 *  )
 * ```
 *
 *```css
 *.h1 {     color : red }
 *```
